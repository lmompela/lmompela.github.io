My research focuses on developing Natural Language Processing tools and resources for under-represented languages, particularly Creole languages. Below are key projects and computational resources I've developed.

## GitHub Repositories

### [MultiParser](https://github.com/lmompela/multiparser)
Multi-parser tool for comparative syntactic analysis across languages.

### [SUPar Creole](https://github.com/lmompela/supar_creole)
Syntactic parsing framework adapted for Creole languages, leveraging state-of-the-art dependency parsing.

### [Creoleum QNLP](https://github.com/lmompela/creoleum-qnlp)
Quantum Natural Language Processing toolkit for Creole languages, exploring quantum-inspired approaches to linguistic analysis.

### [Creoleum MT](https://github.com/lmompela/creoleum-mt)
Machine translation system for Creole languages, focusing on Martinican and Haitian Creole.

### [Creole POS Toolkit](https://github.com/lmompela/Creole_POS_Toolkit)
Part-of-speech tagging toolkit specifically designed for Creole languages.

## HuggingFace Models

### [mBERT Martinican POS Tagger](https://huggingface.co/lmompelat/mbert-martinican-pos-tagger)
Multilingual BERT-based part-of-speech tagger fine-tuned for Martinican Creole.

### [CreoleVal Martinican POS Tagger](https://huggingface.co/lmompelat/creoleval-martinican-pos-tagger)
Specialized POS tagger for Martinican Creole with enhanced performance on Creole-specific constructions.

### [XLM-R Base Martinican POS Tagger](https://huggingface.co/lmompelat/xlm-r-base-martinican-pos-tagger)
XLM-RoBERTa-based POS tagger optimized for Martinican Creole text processing.

These tools and models are part of my broader research agenda to make NLP technology accessible and effective for under-resourced languages, with applications ranging from language preservation to improving healthcare communication.

Ludovic Mompelat is an Assistant Professor of French, Creolistics, and Computational Linguistics at the University of Miami. His research focuses on promoting Creole languages within the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Formal Linguistics, and Sociolinguistics. His most recent publications such as "Simple Morphology, Complex Models: A Benchmark Study and Error Analysis of POS Tagging for Martinican Creole" (2025) and "Recommendations for Overcoming Linguistic Barriers in Healthcare: Challenges and Innovations in NLP for Haitian Creole" (2025) are articulated around two complementary axes: first, the development of NLP tools and models tailored to the typological specificities of Creole languages, and second, the application of these computational innovations to socially critical contexts, such as improving healthcare communication and linguistic access for under-served language communities.

## Research Interests

Natural Language Processing for under-represented languages (with a focus on Creole languages); corpus linguistics; syntactic and morphological theory; sociolinguistics; language contact; machine translation; quantum-inspired NLP; digital humanities platforms for Creole revitalization.

## Past Research Highlights

### Computational Tools for Creole Languages
I have built some of the first NLP resources for Martinican and Haitian Creole, including part‑of‑speech taggers, dependency parsers, and language identification systems. These projects involved creating annotated corpora from the ground up and designing models capable of handling the high rates of polyfunctionality, code‑switching, and syntactic ambiguity characteristic of Creole languages.  
This foundational work now supports downstream applications such as translation, linguistic analysis, educational tools, and corpus exploration.

### Linguistically Informed NLP
A central theme of my research is demonstrating how linguistic theory can guide model design, especially in low‑resource contexts. My work shows that:
- linguistic insight often outperforms brute‑force data scaling,
- typological affinities among Creole languages can support efficient cross‑lingual transfer,
- systematic error analysis enables targeted, high‑impact annotation strategies.

This approach reintroduces linguistic structure into NLP workflows, offering paths forward for both low‑resource languages and meaning‑heavy tasks where large models struggle.

### NLP for Healthcare Communication
I have developed methodology and annotation frameworks for improving Haitian Creole translations in medical contexts. This work addresses semantic accuracy, cultural appropriateness, register, and patient safety, using evaluation criteria adapted from clinical risk frameworks.  
The goal is not to replace human interpreters, but to design tools and guidelines that make healthcare communication more accessible, safe, and culturally aligned for Haitian Creole speakers.

## Rationale & Research Vision

My work is guided by the idea that **languages are under‑represented, not under‑resourced**, and that equitable NLP requires more than scaling data: it requires structural understanding, cultural awareness, and participatory design.

French‑lexified Creoles reveal the limits of current NLP paradigms and offer a site for methodological innovation. By combining linguistics, computation, and community collaboration, my research aims to:
- create sustainable tools for Creole languages,
- promote linguistic equity in technological spaces,
- rethink how NLP engages with meaning, structure, and context,
- design technologies that reflect the lived realities of their speakers.

This perspective links all aspects of my work—from theoretical modeling and corpus creation to healthcare communication, digital humanities, and long‑term infrastructure building.
